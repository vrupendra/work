Execute Previous Commands with sudo

Run last command
[root@localhost ~]# !!
Add a String of Text to an Existing File
[root@localhost ~]# echo ‘string-of-text’ | sudo tee -a /home/node01/cat   [this will create a file if it doesnt exist and append if already exists]

Finding the PID of the process using a specific port?

$ sudo ss -lptn 'sport = :80'
$ sudo netstat -nlp | grep :80
$ sudo lsof -n -i :80 | grep LISTEN
$ ss -pntl 'sport = :6379'
$ fuser -v -n tcp 22

de01@localhost ~]$ pgrep httpd -d' '
6183 6186 6187 6188 6189 6190
$ pgrep -c httpd  [ count no of processes, instead of printing the PID]

And, if you want to display only the oldest or the newest of the processes being run by some particular users, use the -n (newest) or the -o (oldest) option.

$ pgrep -u root -o -l
1 init
$ pgrep -u root -n -l
18192 sshd

$ pidof httpd

su command examples
#su -l username  [switch user with a login script]
#su -s /bin/zsh [ use a diff shell]
#su -p username [Use a Different User in the Same Environment]
#sudo su - [ this will allow to regular user login as root user but enter its passwd istead of root users passwd]

Command Comparison: su vs sudo
sudo Command

The sudo command grants a one-time or limited-time access to root functionality. Typically, the sudo command is used to quickly run an administrative command, then return to the user account’s regular permissions.

su Command

The su command lets you switch the current user to any other user. If you need to run a command as a different (non-root) user, use the –l [username] option to specify the user account. Additionally,su can also be used to change to a different shell interpreter on the fly.

su is an older but more fully-featured command. It can duplicate the functionality of sudo by use of the –c option to pass a single command to the shell.

To provide sudo access, the user has to be added to the sudo group.
