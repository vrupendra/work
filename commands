#Print #no of lines from a file
$ head -10 top-output
$ sed -n 1,8p top-output
$ awk 'FNR<=5' top-output
$ perl -ne'1..9 and print' top-output

#Print only configuration directives from file

$ grep -v "^#" /path/to/config/file
# grep -v "^#|^$"  -> The -v option invert the criteria. The regex ^$ matches and removes all blank lines and ^# matches and removes all comments 
that starts with a “#”.

#Execute Previous Commands with sudo
[root@localhost ~]# !2
Run last command
[root@localhost ~]# !!
Add a String of Text to an Existing File
[root@localhost ~]# echo ‘string-of-text’ | sudo tee -a /home/node01/cat   [this will create a file if it doesnt exist and append if already exists]

#Finding the PID of the process using a specific port?

$ sudo ss -lptn 'sport = :80'
$ sudo netstat -nlp | grep :80
$ sudo lsof -n -i :80 | grep LISTEN
$ ss -pntl 'sport = :6379'
$ fuser -v -n tcp 22

de01@localhost ~]$ pgrep httpd -d' '
6183 6186 6187 6188 6189 6190
$ pgrep -c httpd  [ count no of processes, instead of printing the PID]

And, if you want to display only the oldest or the newest of the processes being run by some particular users, use the -n (newest) or the -o (oldest) option.

$ pgrep -u root -o -l
1 init
$ pgrep -u root -n -l

su command examples
#su -l username  [switch user with a login script]
#su -s /bin/zsh [ use a diff shell]
#su -p username [Use a Different User in the Same Environment]
$ su -   [ this will login as root and ask for root's passwd
#sudo su - [ this will allow the regular user to login as root user but takes its own passwd istead of root users passwd]
## Example##
[node01@localhost ~]$ sudo su -
[sudo] password for node01:


#Command Comparison: su vs sudo
sudo Command

The sudo command grants a one-time or limited-time access to root functionality. Typically, the sudo command is used to quickly run an administrative command, then return to the user account’s regular permissions.

su Command

The su command lets you switch the current user to any other user. If you need to run a command as a different (non-root) user, use the –l [username] option to specify the user account. Additionally,su can also be used to change to a different shell interpreter on the fly.

su is an older but more fully-featured command. It can duplicate the functionality of sudo by use of the –c option to pass a single command to the shell.

To provide sudo access, the user has to be added to the sudo group.

adduser --disabled-login [OPTIONS] user

This option sets the password to !, which means "login is deactivated, user will be unable to login."

Keep in mind that this will only prevent user login - you can still switch to this account from some other using the su command.
